Google Cloud Platform (GCP) basics - https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/2794?parent=catalog

This lab will help you understand GCP and the services offered. I had created a student account and received a total of $400 credit which should be sufficient for you to explore and manage projects for this course.

Complete the lab, take the screenshot of the cloudshell like the one in the repo and push it to your respective repository.

You should name your image like "lab1-YOURNAME.png".
